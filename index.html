					One of the first interesting things to notice
					about floated elements is that margins around
					floated elements do not collapse. If you float an
					image with 20-pixel margins, there will be at
					least 20 pixels of space around that image. If
					other elements adjacent to the image—and that
					means adjacent horizontally and vertically—also
					have mar‐ gins, those margins will not collapse
					with the margins on the floated image, as you can
					see in There is only one and that is me.
